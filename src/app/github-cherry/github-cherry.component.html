                Cherry Picking is a way for developers to "pick" a commit from a branch and transfer it to another
                branch. This is useful if a branch contains too
                many mistakes or there is a significant change which might jeopardise the current code base and needed
                to be transferred to a branch where the code is safe to use. In this blog, we will discuss how we can do
                that
                using Github Desktop. ðŸ‘Œ

                You are all set! If you made it this far, the rest of the project should be fine, hopefully. Just beware
                of merge conflicts. To avoid this, please consult
                with you advisor or group leader. To proceed, you might want to check out
